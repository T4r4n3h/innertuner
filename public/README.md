## Inspiration 
As we all strive to acheive a healthier body with sound mind, many people invest heavy effort to make improvements. However, nothing can be built over night and we must start with smaller steps with acheivable goals. We trully believe that changing everyday habits can and will gradually tranform our lives. 

That's when INNERTUNER App was created. We have selected three daily habits that majority of our peers value and work on to increase quality of life. The App allows users to track their daily habits in seconds, via intuitive interface and design. 

With sleek and easy-to-read visual progress bars, tracking habit and its influnece will become an easy step to adopt into their lives to make sustainable changes. 


## Functionalities: 

Users can set desired goals to acheive for each habit. For example a user can wish to drink 2 Liters of Water, get 8 hours of Sleep, and spend 30 minute to work out daily. They can always visit profile page to edit the goals afterwards.

Users can log the progress through out the day. They have options to log manually or choose to use suggested standard increments. The progress they make towards the goal will be easy to track visually via Daily Habit Progress Bars. 

Further more, we introduced a feature to track daily emotion in simple mood indicators: bad, neutral, good. These daily emotions are also visually trackable in the same manner as Habit Progress Bar at the very center of the App (Weekly Mood Progress Bar). This will allow the user to navigate their ideal habit pattern to accomplish and maintain happy and healthy life-style. 


## Technologies and Language Used (MERN)
 
 INNERTUNER was built on MERN stack : 
 MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, JavaScript and Tailwindcss.


## Design with optimal UX & UI
With INNERTUNER team's initial idea, we had a previlege to consult and worked with two UX & UI Designer students. Our goal was to create a mobile first App. After several in-depth meetings and feedback sesssions, we were able to achieve a polished look with user expereince in mind as a group. 

Our App front-end was developed utilizing Tailwindcss as the primary styling framework and we were able to acheive final look as close as possible to the proposed initial design.
