# Inspiration 
As we all strive to acheive a healthier body with sound mind, many people invest heavy effort to make improvements. However, nothing can be built over night and we must start with smaller steps with acheivable goals. We trully believe that changing everyday habits can and will gradually tranform our lives. 

That's when INNER TUNER App was created. We have selected three daily habits that majority of our peers value and work on to increase quality of live. The APP allows users to track the habits daily via intuitive interface and design within seconds. 

## Functionalities: 

Users can set goals to ideally acheive per habit. For example a user can wish to drink 2 Liters of Water Consuption, get 8 hours of Sleep, and spend 30 minute to work out daily. They can always visit profile page to edit the goals.

Users can log the progress through out the day. They have options to log manually or choose to use standard increments we suggest. The progress they make towards the goal will be easy to track visually via Daily Habit Progress bar. 

Further more, we introduced a feature to track daily emotion in simple terms of bad, neutral, good emojis.Daily emotions are also visually trackable in the same manner as Habit Progress Bar at the very center of the App. This will allow the user to navigate their ideal habit pattern to accomplish and maintain happy state. 

With pleasant and easy to read visual progress bars, tracking habit and its influnece will become an easy step to adopt into their lives to make changes permanent.

# Design with optimal UX & UI
With INNER TUNER team's initial idea, we had a previlege to consult and worked with 2 UX & UI Designer students. After in-depth meetings and feedback sesssions, we were able to achieve polished look with user expereince in mind as a group. 

Our Front-end developer utilized Tail-end as the primary CSS framework and was able to acheive the look as close to the final APP design as possible.
